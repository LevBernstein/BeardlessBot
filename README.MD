# Beardless Bot

### Lev Bernstein

A Discord bot supporting gambling (coin flips and blackjack),
a currency system, fun facts, and more.

Originally created for use in eggsoup's discord server. 

## Installation

1. Download the repository.

2. Create a file named "token.txt" that contains your Discord API token (you can get a token [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)).

4. Create a file named "catToken.txt" that contains your Cat API token (you can get a token [here](https://thecatapi.com/signup/)).

7. Place both token files in the resources folder.

Alternatively, if you just want to add the bot to your own Discord server while I host it, you can simply [click this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=654133911558946837&permissions=8&scope=bot).
