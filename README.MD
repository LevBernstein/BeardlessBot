# Beardless Bot

### Full Release v1.3.4

### Lev Bernstein

A Discord bot supporting gambling (coin flips and blackjack),
a currency system, fun facts, and more.

Originally created for use in eggsoup's discord server. 

## Installation

1. Download the repository.

2. Download [Python 3](https://python.org/downloads), and then run `pip install -r resources/requirements.txt`.

3. Create a file named "token.txt" that contains your Discord API token (you can get a token [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)).

4. Place the token file in the resources folder.

5. As of Full Release v1.3.0, Beardless Bot supports calls to the Brawlhalla API. If you don't have [an API key](https://dev.brawlhalla.com/), those commands will simply be disabled; the Bot will work fine. If you do have an API key, place it in a file named "brawlhallaKey.txt" in the resources folder.

Alternatively, if you just want to add the bot to your own Discord server while I host it, you can simply [click this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=654133911558946837&permissions=8&scope=bot), then skip down to [Setup](#setup).

## Setup

* To use the !spar command, create a channel named looking-for-spar.

* To use Beardless Bot's event logging, create a channel named bb-log.

* To use special colors, create roles named special red, special blue, special pink, and special orange.
