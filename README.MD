# Beardless Bot

A Discord bot supporting gambling (coin flips and blackjack),
a currency system, fun facts, and more.

Originally created for use in eggsoup's discord server. 

## Installation

Simply clone the repository. You will need to make your own token.txt; 
this should contain your Discord API token.

Alternatively, if you just want to add the bot to your own Discord 
server while I host it, you can simply click this link:
